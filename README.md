# Depression_game
Not finished beta version of the game about surviving as depressed Emily. Since I have very broad experience on how depression can affect people (including myself), I decided to write a game about the worst mechanism - dealing with less energy than other people. In game you have a lot of Emily's statistics, and your goal is not to get in trouble, which means not going under 15% on each stat. So whole experience is survival through 8 days, but I did only one piece of the first day. Pieces are iterable, so I have to finish it and add only missing three. 
I implemented mechanisms for checking hunger of Emily, counting money, and using discipline or comfort to rise levels of other stats. The most important thing here are action points, and random side-effects of actions.

The reason I didn't finish this game is lack of creativity days. Most mechanisms are created, but I don't have time to think about plot filling properly.
